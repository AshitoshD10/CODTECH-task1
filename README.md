Weather App

This project is a responsive weather web application that provides real-time weather information for any searched city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to enter a city name and instantly view current weather details such as temperature (in Celsius), humidity level, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The app dynamically updates weather icons based on the weather condition returned by the API (such as Clear, Clouds, Rain, Drizzle, and Mist). It also includes error handling to display a message when an invalid city is entered or when data cannot be fetched from the API.

The project is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, including asynchronous API requests using Fetch and async/await. The application focuses on clean UI design, real-time data handling, and basic error management to improve user experience.

This project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, API integration, asynchronous programming, and dynamic content updating.
